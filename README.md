1. Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will make a purchase, based on various customer-related features.

2. Dataset Information:
   
The dataset includes the following features:

Customer_ID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Age: Age of the customer in years.

Annual_Income: Annual income of the customer in USD.

Gender: Gender of the customer.

Purchase_History: Indicator of whether the customer has made a purchase (1) or not (0).

Product_Category: Category of products the customer is interested in or has purchased.

Customer_Satisfaction: Customer satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10.

Loyalty_Points: Points accumulated by the customer through a loyalty program.

Marital_Status: Marital status of the customer.

Number_of_Children: Number of children the customer has.

Employment_Status: Employment status of the customer.

Credit_Score: Credit score of the customer.

Owns_House: Indicator of whether the customer owns a house (True/False).

Monthly_Expenditure: Estimated monthly expenditure of the customer in USD.

Internet_Usage_Hours_per_Week: Hours per week the customer spends on the internet.

4. Project Steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights from the data and visualizing relationships between features.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
- Modeling: Building and training machine learning models to predict customer purchases.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using relevant metrics.
- Prediction: Using the model to predict whether a customer will make a purchase.

4. Tools and Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning (Classification)
